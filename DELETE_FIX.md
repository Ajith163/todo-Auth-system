# 🗑️ Delete User Functionality Fix

## ❌ Current Problem
Delete option in admin dashboard is not working properly.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Database Imports**
- Updated DELETE endpoint to use proper imports
- Fixed dynamic import issues with todos schema
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added detailed error logging in frontend
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added response parsing for better feedback

### 3. **Database Connection Fix**
- Updated to use `getDatabase()` instead of direct `db` import
- Ensures proper database initialization
- Prevents connection issues

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **API Endpoint** (`app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.js`)
- ✅ Fixed imports: `users, todos` from schema
- ✅ Updated to use `getDatabase()` function
- ✅ Removed dynamic imports that were causing issues
- ✅ Added proper error handling

### **Frontend** (`components/dashboard/admin-dashboard.js`)
- ✅ Added detailed logging for delete operations
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with response parsing
- ✅ Better user feedback for success/error states

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Deploy the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix delete user functionality"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Test Delete Functionality
1. **Login as admin** - admin@example.com / admin123
2. **Go to admin dashboard**
3. **Find a user in the "Approved" tab**
4. **Click the "Delete" button**
5. **Confirm the deletion**
6. **Verify user is removed**

### Step 3: Run Test Script
```bash
npm run test-delete
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a test user with todos
- ✅ Test the delete process
- ✅ Verify todos are deleted first
- ✅ Verify user is deleted
- ✅ Show detailed results

## 🎯 Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ Delete button works in admin dashboard
- ✅ Confirmation dialog appears
- ✅ User and associated todos are deleted
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ User list refreshes automatically
- ✅ No errors in console

## 📞 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check browser console** - Look for error messages
2. **Check network tab** - Verify API calls are working
3. **Run test script** - `npm run test-delete`
4. **Check database** - Verify tables exist and are accessible
5. **Check permissions** - Ensure admin role is working

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Check API Response
```javascript
// In browser console, test the API directly:
fetch('/api/admin/users/1', { method: 'DELETE' })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
```

### Check Database
```bash
npm run test-db
```

### Check User Permissions
```bash
npm run fix-admin
```
